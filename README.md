# JanitorTTT2
A new traitor role for TTT2, the Janitor.

### How to play
The Janitor comes equipped with two abilities. The first ability "cleans" a body, effectively removing it from the game and stopping it from being identified. The second ability allows the janitor to remove DNA from a body, which could work well with a forger trying to make a murder seem like an accident.
